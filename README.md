# docker-drive
This a dockerized version of odeke-dm/drive for accessing your google drive.

## Usage

Follow the instructions for the odeke-dm/drive To run I've create a small
called docker-drive which will use a docker-drive folder in your home directory.

The container will be away of your current directory based on information
passed by the script.  So commands relitive to a child directory will work
as expected.
